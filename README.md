Project Description
===================

Using Linked Open Data to improve Machine Learning Algorithms.

Example Pipeline:

1. Download Wine Ontology & Knowledge (KB) from DBpedia.
2. Download Wine data set from UCIrvine library.
3. Test the data set with Naive Bayes.
4. Now, search knowledge base (KB) for wine information and build a graphical structure
   (and graphical model?) to represent the data and its properties.
5. Use that knowledge to bias Naive Bayes.
6. Test with the new implementation of Naive Bayes.
